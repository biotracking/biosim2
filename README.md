BioSim
=======

BioSim is a toolkit intended to allow the quick creation of simulations of 
biological agents without getting bogged down in the plumbing of writing
your own simulator. Our target audience includes biologists looking for
tools for agent based simulation, and multi-agent systems researchers 
interested in biologically plausible simulation systems.

BioSim is a work in progress, and is used in active research so while we 
will try to keep things in working order, they will occasionally break.

BioSim is built on top of MASON:
